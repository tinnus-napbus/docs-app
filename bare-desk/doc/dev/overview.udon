The %docs app allows you to include documentation with the desks you
distribute, making them available for easy browsing by users and developers.

The %docs app will automatically detect and publish any docs included with any
installed desks. As long as they're in the correct place, of a filetype with
appropriate `mark` conversion methods, and include a
[`doc.toc`](/docs/docs/dev/index-file) index file, they'll be
picked up.

A `doc.toc` file may be included in the root of the desk, specifying the files
to be included, their `mark`s, and their titles. See the [Index File](/docs/docs/dev/index-file) section for details.

The files themselves will be in a `/doc` directory in the root of the desk. In
`/doc`, there'll be two subdirectories - `/usr` and `/dev`. The former will contain
docs for users, and the latter will contain docs for developers. The `/dev`
directory may have one further level: directories named for agents on the desk,
and containing docs specifically for those agents.

The directory hierarchy may therefore look something like this:

```
doc
├── dev
│   ├── overview.udon
│   └── foo-store
│       ├── api-ref.udon
│       └── data-types.udon
└── usr
    ├── changelog.udon
    └── overview.udon
```

The docs themselves may be of any filetype, as long as it has conversion methods
to the `%docu` mark used by the %docs app. The %docs app includes parsers and
conversion methods for the following marks by default:

- `%txt` - Ordinary `.txt` text files.
- `%udon` - A markdown-like format that supports embedded hoon.
- `%gmi` - An ultra-minimalist markup format called "gemtext".
- `%html` - An ordinary `.html` file.

For more details of these file formats, as well as details of the `%docu` mark
and other format requirements of the %docs app, see the [File
Format](/docs/docs/dev/file-format) section.

Apart from the `mark` and location requirements described above, there are no
particular restrictions on how you organise your docs, or what docs you include.
There are, however, some general recommendations detailed in the [Suggested
Structure](/docs/docs/dev/structure) section.

## Dev desk

To include docs in your own desk, there are a few files you'll need (mark files,
etc). These are included in the `docs-dev` dev desk in the [github
repo](https://github.com/tinnus-napbus/docs-app). These files are all symlinked,
so you'll need to clone the whole repo, then copy them across with something
like:

```
cp -rL git/docs-app/docs-dev/* /path/to/your/development/desk
```
